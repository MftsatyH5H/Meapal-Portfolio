        Human Resources are at the heart of our development strategy, whether
        it’s a matter of sniffing out young talents for emerging technologies or
        recruiting people who are experienced and proven in their fields. It’s
        also a matter of reinforcing values via the use of our brand, proposing
        a framework and a stimulating work environment that provides you with
        the best conditions in which to do your work and grow and move on in
        your career.Our HR policy, at the heart of our development strategy, is
        based on three fundamental values :
      </p>

      <h2 className="visionpage-h2">PERFORMANCE & INNOVATION</h2>
      <p className="vision-text">
        Company performance is primarily the result of personal performance.
        Furthering skills is a central part of Human Resources at CORELIA.
        Investing in ourselves, investing in our employees is investing in the
        performance of our group and this is why training is at the heart of our
        strategy and why our commitment to training goes beyond that which is
        legally required. Occupational evolution, different kinds of technology,
        developer and manufacturer certifications, seminars, internal workshops
        and unsupervised learning are all tools that we have made available to
        our employees. Innovation is not a buzz word for all to see, but rather
        the powerful drive behind our strategy. It is what everyone has to add
        to the collective methods and processes. It is the guarantee of a stream
        of rich and varied projects that are at the cutting edge of technology.
      </p>

      <h2 className="visionpage-h2">SKILL AND TEAM COHESION</h2>
      <p className="vision-text">
        We live in a world that is always changing because disruptive technology
        appears faster and faster and because technology is vast and has an ever
        greater impact on professions we are convinced that, more than ever,
        team cohesion, the pool of skills - collective intelligence in short -
        is greater, stronger and holds more potential than any one person's
        intelligence. Matching skills, collective intelligence and disruptive
        technology is the heart of, and drive behind, our strategy and our
        know-how. It’s in our DNA, we give our clients a new way to operate. Our
        matrix-based organization promotes short decision-making decisions, good
        communication and ensures proximity. Cross-sector working groups and
        expert communities provide for rich discussions and thus
        decompartmentalise knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2 className="visionpage-h2">CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</h2>
      <p className="vision-text">
        Client satisfaction is at the heart of everything we do. We are
        convinced that this satisfaction is the result of every single thing we
        do upstream to ensure that the client's goals are met. This is why we
        are committed, day in, day out, to this excellence and have it audited
        so that we comply with the very high and demanding requirements of the
        standards and certifications that we have been awarded. We are also
        convinced that it also comes from our ability to encourage innovative
        solutions. This is not innovation for the sake of innovation but rather
        some proactive effort to create value in our client’s professions, even
        in those areas in which they have not yet dreamt of it.
